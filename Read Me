Detailed Description and Installation Commands 

To Run the code open the code file and Run the login.py Code

tkinter: This is a standard Python package used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It doesn't require a separate installation with standard Python distributions but might need installation via your system's package manager on minimal setups.

For Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
For Fedora:
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
For macOS:
brew install python-tk
Pillow: A fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL) used for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.

pip install pillow
OpenCV: An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It contains functions for real-time computer vision.

pip install opencv-python
OpenCV-contrib: This package includes additional modules that are not part of the main OpenCV library.

pip install opencv-contrib-python
numpy: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things a powerful N-dimensional array object.

pip install numpy
bcrypt: A password hashing library for Python. It allows you to hash and check passwords securely.

pip install bcrypt
mysql-connector-python: A MySQL driver written in Python which allows you to connect to a MySQL database.

pip install mysql-connector-python
smtplib: This package is part of Python's standard library. It is used for sending emails via the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). No installation is required.

datetime: This module is also part of Python's standard library and is used for manipulating dates and times. No installation is required.

Explanation of Libraries and Their Uses in the Code
tkinter: Used for creating the GUI for the Forgot Password page and other UI elements.
Pillow (PIL): Used for image processing tasks such as resizing the background image for the GUI.
OpenCV and OpenCV-contrib: Commonly used in face recognition and other computer vision tasks, which might be relevant if you have other parts of the application dealing with such functionalities.
numpy: Often used in conjunction with OpenCV for handling arrays and image data.
bcrypt: Provides secure password hashing, ensuring that user passwords are stored securely in the database.
mysql-connector-python: Facilitates connecting to and interacting with the MySQL database to retrieve and update user information.
smtplib: Utilized for sending emails, specifically for sending password reset emails in this code.
datetime: Useful for handling date and time operations, such as timestamping password reset requests.
By installing these packages and using the provided code, you can implement a functional "Forgot Password" feature in your application.
